`whalewatcher` is a simple Golang module that watches Docker and plain
containerd containers becoming "alive" with processes and later die, keeping
track of only the "alive" containers. On purpose, this module focuses solely on
_running_ and _paused_ containers, so those only that have at least an initial
container process running (and thus a PID).

Envisioned use cases are container-aware tools â€“ such as
[lxkns](https://github.com/thediveo/lxkns) â€“ that seemingly randomly need the
current state of affairs for all running containers. That is, tools that yet do
not want to do the ugly lifting of container engine event tracking, engine state
resynchronization after reconnects, et cetera. Here, the `whalewatcher` module
reduces system load especially when state is requested in bursts, as it offers a
load-optimized kind of "cache". Yet this cache is always closely synchronized to
the container engine state.

> ðŸ›ˆ If your application requires immediate action upon container lifecycle
> events then our `whalewatcher` **isn't the right module** for it: our module
> is design for those use cases where the application needing information about
> containers is completely decoupled from container lifecycle events.

## Features

- tracks container information with respect to a container's ID/name, PID,
  labels, (un)pausing state, and optional (composer) project. See the
  [`whalewatcher.Container`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/thediveo/whalewatcher#Container)
  type for details.
- supports different container engines:
  - [Docker/Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby)
  - plain [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd)
- composer project-aware:
  - [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)
- optional configurable automatic retries using
  [backoffs](github.com/cenkalti/backoff) (with different strategies as
  supported by the external backoff module).
- documentation ... please see:

## Example Usage

From `example/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "sort"

    "github.com/thediveo/whalewatcher/watcher/moby"
)

func main() {
    // connect to the Docker engine; configure no backoff.
    whalewatcher, err := moby.New("unix:///var/run/docker.sock", nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    fmt.Printf("watching engine ID: %s\n", whalewatcher.ID(ctx))

    // run the watch in a separate go routine.
    done := make(chan struct{})
    go func() {
        if err := whalewatcher.Watch(ctx); ctx.Err() != context.Canceled {
            panic(err)
        }
        close(done)
    }()

    // depending on application you don't need to wait for the first results to
    // become ready; in this example we want to wait for results.
    <-whalewatcher.Ready()

    // get list of projects; we add the unnamed "" project which automatically
    // contains all non-project (standalone) containers.
    projectnames := append(whalewatcher.Portfolio().Names(), "")
    sort.Strings(projectnames)
    for _, projectname := range projectnames {
        containers := whalewatcher.Portfolio().Project(projectname)
        if containers == nil {
            continue // doh ... gone!
        }
        fmt.Printf("project %q:\n", projectname)
        for _, container := range containers.Containers() {
            fmt.Printf("  container %q with PID %d\n", container.Name, container.PID)
        }
        fmt.Println()
    }

    // finally stop the watch
    cancel()
    <-done
    whalewatcher.Close()
}
```

## Hacking It

This project comes with comprehensive unit tests, including (limited) mocking of
Docker clients to the small extend required for whale watching.
